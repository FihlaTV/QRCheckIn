          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            QR Check In is a mobile phone application to provide electronic ticket check ins using QR codes. It will scan a QR code printed on a ticket and, using a generic REST API, attempt to check in the ticket with the configured server endpoint. The application is designed to be used with a server which you implement that exposes a REST API that conforms to the required <a href="./rest_api.html">QR Check In server API</a>. This allows web sites that need ticketing to implement QR code check ins without having to develop a mobile phone application. 
          </p>
          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            The application was developed for a community radio station to use for checking in tickets that they sell online for their fund-raising events. It was designed to work with a generic back end so that it could be plugged into other web sites that may have a use for it. The code is also being released as open source in the event it may be useful to someone who wants to implement something similar (but different).
          </p>
          <h3>License</h3>
          <p>
            QR Check In is open source to allow customisation to suit a project's needs. The license for the code is the MIT License (<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php</a>).
          </p>

          <h3>QR Check In Development</h3>
          <p>
            QR Check In is built using <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap&#0153;</a> to support different phone devices without having to have multiple code bases. As a Phonegap application the application is developed entirely using HTML5 and JavaScript. The PhoneGap barcode scanner plugin is used for the QR code scanning functionality. To keep a good separation between the logic and presentation the application is developed with the JavaScript MVVM framework <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">knockout.js</a>. To simplify development the application was designed to be built using the online Adobe&reg; PhoneGap Build service <a href="http://build.phonegap.com">http://build.phonegap.com</a>. Simply by creating a new Build project and pointing it at the GitHub repo the application can be built. This removes the need to setup a PhoneGap build environment locally. In addition, PhoneGap Build can be used for free for Github-hosted open source projects.

          The QR Check in application uses the Entypo pictograms by Daniel Bruce (<a href="http://www.entypo.com">www.entypo.com</a>).
